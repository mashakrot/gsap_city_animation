👉 Dynamic SVG Loading: Fetches and injects city.svg into the DOM for scalable graphics.

👉 Scroll-Triggered Timeline: Pins the city container and sequences scale + opacity animations via GSAP’s timeline and ScrollTrigger.

👉 Layered Parallax: Individual city parts (rooftops, walls, interiors) move at different speeds to simulate depth.

👉 Responsive & Adaptive: SVG preserves aspect ratio and adapts to any viewport size.

👉 Modular Code: app.js cleanly separates “load SVG” and “set animation” logic for easy tweaks.
